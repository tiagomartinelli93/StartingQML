Some tasks which I've done in the QMLedX2019 course

For the codes work, you have to download the packages from the D-Wave Ocean suite, and all necessary functions you are going to use (in my case, I used Qiskit). Note that the solvers used the QC provided by D-wave. To install the tools and configure for running problems on D-Wave remote compute resources, including quantum-classical hybrid solvers and the D-Wave quantum processing unit (QPU), or locally on your CPU see the link below:
